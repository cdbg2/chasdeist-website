# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a static personal website for Chas Deist. No build tools, package managers, or frameworks are used.

## Development

Open `My Website/index.html` directly in a browser to preview. No server required.

## Architecture

- **My Website/index.html** - Single-page portfolio with header, about section, contact form, and footer
- **My Website/styles.css** - Custom CSS using Source Serif 4 Google Font, mobile-responsive (480px breakpoint)

## Notes

- Contact form uses Formspree (requires form ID configuration in the action URL)
- Design uses a minimal, centered layout with 600px max-width container
